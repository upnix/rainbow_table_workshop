# Jupyter notebook to learn about Rainbow Tables
The goal is to teach the basic concepts of Rainbow Tables using a Jupyter notebook and IPython widgets. This is for a workshop that must be 1 hour or less, and for an audience of students who have graduated from grade 10 or 11.

The time limitation and my skills with IPython widgets are the two limiting factors for what content is included. Ideally, I will continue to add supplementary material to round out the content presented.
