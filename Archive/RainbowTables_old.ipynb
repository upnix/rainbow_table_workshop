    "* Cryptographic hashes are used to digitally sign data, allowing applications and people to be reasonably assured that the data they're seeing came from the expected source, and is the same data that was originally sent.\n",
    "* This is very similar to the file hashing we saw earlier, except now we hash the important data, then encrypt that data along with the hash.\n",
    "* In this scenario the cryptographic hash is used along with public key cryptography...\n",
    "* So very quickly - in public key cryptography there are key pairs which are different, but linked. Any data encrypted by one of the keys can be decrypted by its pair, regardless of whether we're calling the key the \"public\" or the \"private\" one.\n",
    "* Actually, the only difference between a private key and a public key is the private key is the one you keep private.\n",
    "* So here, Alice has some plain text she wants to securely send to Bob. She uses Bob's public key, which is available for anyone to use, and encrypts her plain text.\n",
    "* That encrypted text is sent to Bob. Since only Bob's private key can decrypt data encrypted with his public key, and Bob has kept his private key private, only Bob can decrypt this encrypted data...\n",
    "* But there's a sneaky problem here. Bob's public key is, of course, public. Someone could intercept Alice's encrypted message to Bob, and while that attacker couldn't read the contents, they could create their own message, encrypt it again with Bob's public key, and send that instead. Bob would have no idea that the message he recieved wasn't actually from Alice.\n",
    "* The solution is cryptographic hashes! And, more public key crypto...\n",
    "* To sign her message, Alice now sends the plain text message through a cryptographic hash function - in this case MD5.\n",
    "* Then, she encrypts that hash with her own private key, and adds the result to the end of her plaintext message.\n",
    "* Finally, just like was originally done, she encrypts the whole thing with Bob's public key.\n",
    "* Bob can decrypt the message, he sees the plain text information, but also the encrypted hash...\n",
    "* Because Bob was expecting this, he knows that he should use Alice's public key to decrypt the hash\n",
    "* Next, he takes his own hash of the plain text he recieved (being sure to exclude the appended encrypted hash)\n",
    "* He compares the decrypted hash with his own hash. If they match, he knows the text is the original text, and it was sent by Alice.\n",
    "* Why does he know this? Because Alice's public key decrypted the correct hash, meaning it had to have been her private key that encrypted it. And by convention, we trust that Alice is the only one who has access to her private key.\n",
    "* We know the plain text was the text Alice sent, because our hash of the text matches the unencrypted hash that Alice sent. And one of the properties of a cryptographic hash is that it shouldn't be possible to modify hash input without creating significantly different hash output."

    "* The data being hashed consists of hashes from previously computed \"blocks\" (the contents of which I'm not entirely familiar with), and a random number called a \"nonce.\"\n",
    "* Cryptominers modify this random number each time they try a new hash. They're looking for the random number which, when coupled with previously accepted hash values, produce an output hash with a certain number of leading zeros.\n",

So Bitcoin miners toil away, computing billions of hashes, hoping that they'll be the one to find the magic random number that gets the target number of leading zeros. "
